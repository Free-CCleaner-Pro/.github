## Purpose:
The main purpose of CCleaner Pro is to help users maintain their computer's speed, improve efficiency, and protect their privacy by:
- **Removing temporary files, internet browser history, cookies, and other junk files that accumulate over time and take up disk space.**
- **Cleaning the Windows Registry (though this should be done with caution).**
- **Managing startup programs to potentially speed up boot times.**
- **Providing tools to uninstall software.**
## Key Features of CCleaner
- **Automatic Cleaning**: This feature allows CCleaner Pro to automatically clean your computer based on specific triggers, such as when a certain amount of junk files has accumulated or when you close your web browser. This provides continuous, hands-off maintenance.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: CCleaner Pro can monitor your system in the background and alert you when it's time for a clean-up, or even perform cleaning automatically based on your settings.
- **Software Updater**: A significant feature in Pro that checks for available updates for other software installed on your computer and allows you to update them directly through CCleaner. Keeping software updated is important for security and stability.
- **Performance Optimizer**: This feature helps identify programs that might be slowing down your PC and allows you to put them to sleep when not in use, potentially improving overall speed and responsiveness.
- **Driver Updater**: (Often included in higher-tier Pro bundles like "Pro Plus" or "Premium") This tool scans for outdated hardware drivers and helps you update them, which can improve hardware performance, stability, and compatibility.
- **PC Health Check**: A more comprehensive analysis of your PC's health compared to the free version, providing recommendations for improvements across speed, security, and space.
- **Cloud Drive Cleaner**: (A newer feature often in higher tiers) Scans and analyzes cloud storage accounts like Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive to help you find and remove duplicate, large, or old files.
- **Priority Customer Support**: Subscribers typically receive faster and more dedicated customer support.
## Target Audience:
CCleaner Pro is suitable for individuals and potentially small businesses who want more automation, real-time protection, and advanced tools for maintaining their computer's performance and cleanliness without manual intervention for basic tasks.
